# Python_game_Sim.py
This is a python gaming program that asks the user to select between two games # to play: Guess the Number, and Rock Paper Scissors.
This Python program offers a choice between two games: "Guess the Number" and "Rock Paper Scissors." The program uses the `random` module to generate random numbers, facilitating the gameplay. The `openGame()` function presents a menu to the user, allowing them to select a game. The `startGame1()` function initiates the "Guess the Number" game, where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100, comparing it to the computer's randomly chosen number, with feedback provided for higher or lower guesses. The `startGame2()` function begins the "Rock Paper Scissors" game, where the user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects one as well, with the program determining the winner based on the game rules. Both games feature retry options (`tryAgain1()` and `tryAgain2()`), and invalid inputs are handled using validation functions (`printInvalidMessage1()` and `printInvalidMessage2()`). The program also includes welcome and goodbye messages, enhancing user interaction. Key components used include `random.randint()` for generating random numbers, while loops for continuous input until valid responses are given, and if/elif/else statements for game logic and flow control.
